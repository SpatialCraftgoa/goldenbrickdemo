# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide for Dubai Interactive Map

## Quick Start (5 minutes to live site!)

### Method 1: Deploy via Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already done):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Netlify deployment"
git push origin main
```

2. **Go to Netlify:**
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up/login (can use GitHub account)
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"

3. **Connect Repository:**
   - Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
   - Select your `goldenbrickdemo` repository
   - Choose the `main` branch

4. **Configure Build Settings:**
   ```
   Base directory: (leave empty)
   Build command: npm run build
   Publish directory: public
   Functions directory: netlify/functions
   ```

5. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Go to Site Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add these variables:
   ```
   JWT_SECRET = your-super-secret-key-minimum-32-characters
   NODE_ENV = production
   ```

6. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
   - Your site will be live at `https://random-name.netlify.app`

### Method 2: Deploy via Command Line

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI (if not installed)
npm install netlify-cli --save-dev

# Login to Netlify
npx netlify login

# Initialize project
npx netlify init
# Follow prompts to connect to existing site or create new one

# Set environment variables
npx netlify env:set JWT_SECRET "your-super-secret-key-minimum-32-characters"
npx netlify env:set NODE_ENV "production"

# Deploy to production
npx netlify deploy --prod
```

## 🎯 What Happens During Deployment

1. **Static Files**: Your `public/` folder is served as static content
2. **API Functions**: Your Express routes become serverless functions
3. **Database**: Uses in-memory storage (for demo) - see production notes below
4. **SSL**: Automatic HTTPS certificate
5. **CDN**: Global content delivery network

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### netlify.toml
Your configuration includes:
- API route redirects to functions
- Static file caching headers
- Security headers
- SPA fallback routing

### Functions
- `netlify/functions/auth.js` - Authentication endpoints
- `netlify/functions/markers.js` - Marker CRUD operations

## 🔐 Security & Environment Variables

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secure key for JWT tokens (minimum 32 characters)
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"

**Optional Variables:**
- `CUSTOM_DOMAIN`: If using custom domain

## 📊 Production Database Setup

The current setup uses in-memory storage for demo purposes. For production:

1. **Option 1: Netlify + Supabase**
```bash
# Sign up at supabase.com
# Create new project
# Add to environment variables:
# SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
# SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

2. **Option 2: Netlify + PlanetScale**
```bash
# Sign up at planetscale.com
# Create database
# Add connection string to environment variables
```

3. **Option 3: Use FaunaDB**
```bash
# Sign up at fauna.com
# Create database
# Add FAUNA_SECRET to environment variables
```

## 🌍 Custom Domain Setup

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Go to Domain settings
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter your domain name

2. **Update DNS:**
   - Point your domain's DNS to Netlify
   - Netlify will provide DNS records to configure

3. **SSL:**
   - SSL certificate is automatically provisioned
   - Force HTTPS is enabled by default

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

Once connected to GitHub:
- Push to main branch → Auto-deploy
- Pull requests → Deploy previews
- Environment variables → Managed in Netlify

## 📱 Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these features:
1. ✅ Map loads correctly
2. ✅ Dubai landmarks are visible
3. ✅ Login with admin/admin works
4. ✅ Can add new markers (admin)
5. ✅ Media slider functions properly
6. ✅ Responsive design on mobile

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Failed:**
   - Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
   - Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`

2. **Functions Not Working:**
   - Verify `netlify.toml` redirects
   - Check function logs in Netlify dashboard

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Ensure variables are set in Netlify dashboard
   - Restart deployment after adding variables

4. **CORS Issues:**
   - Functions include CORS headers
   - Check browser console for errors
